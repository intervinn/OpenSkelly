# Who are we?

We are the Skelly team. Providing modern tools to help developers create high end cross platform products for users. We want to ehance your experience with developing systems while giving you all the control you need.

# How are we different?

Well, most languages, you don't need to worry about memory. Even if a language provides memory control, it will still handle it for you (Go, C#, etc). C/C++ may be too hard for others to learn or just not matching their needs. With Skelly, we aim to provide a suitable solution to this problem while allowing you to freely control your memory. Don't worry about causing leaks, Skelly will still help you and ensure you have optimised code.

# Our goal

We aim to provide cross platform development tools with the ease of controlling memory at your desire or to let the compiler handle it for you. We want to give a mix of freedom and support with our programming language. We primarily want to focus on creating Skelly as a multi-purpose tool that can be used anywhere. Specifically in middle-level areas or such content where Skelly could provide better functionality than other languages such as JavaScript, etc.
